## Create nodes

Creating a master or a worker node with virtual machines is the same. 
1. Chose/Create a resource group. I created `learning-k8s`
2. Name the VM
3. Use Ubuntu, as usual
4. The master node does not need a whole lot of resources while the worker node may need more. Select the appropriate size
5. Select SSH to login
6. Generate or use an existing key pair

### Networking

All the nodes must be on the same network. After creating the master node, I was able to select the same Virtual Network for the worker nodes.

## Master node

We are going to install [[tools/kubeadm|kubeadm]] on the master node. The instructions are available [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)

## swap off
Turn swap off on all the nodes
`sudo swapoff -a`

## Open ports

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/

This should probably be done with Ansible. Maybe AKS already set all of this up.
