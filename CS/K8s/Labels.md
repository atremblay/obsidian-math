Labels are very useful to find what you are looking for in a very crowded cluster. For example, [[Components/Pod|Pods]]’ name will be appended by some hash so it’s tedious to know and write out every single one of them. Instead, many [[tools/kubectl|kubectl]] commands have the options `--show-labels` to print out all the labels of a component or `-l` to select components with a specific label.
