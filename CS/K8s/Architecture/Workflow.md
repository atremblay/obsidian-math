The architecture is very simple from a high level perspective. It consists of only [[Master|master nodes]] and [[Worker|worker nodes]].

Add new [[Master]]/[[Worker]] server:
1. Get new bare server
2. Install all the master/worker node processes
3. Add it to the cluster


> [!question] 
> Is provisioning the new bare server is done via Terraform?
