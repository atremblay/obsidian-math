$\mathbf{\dot{x}} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \Leftarrow \mathbf{\dot{x}} = \mathbf{f(x)}$ near a fixed point $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ where $\mathbf{f(\bar{x})}=\mathbf{0}$

We can use the Taylor expansion to set $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{\frac{Df}{Dx}}$, but we don't know for sure that the higher order terms, the ones we drop, do not totally break the local structure around the fixed points.

This theorem says that for [[Fixed point#Hyperbolic fixed point|hyperbolic systems]], small perturbations don't structurally change the basic structure and shape of everything around the fixed points. Away from the fixed points, all bets are off, but zoom in enough and it looks linear.

This does not work for the neutrally stable points (circles). Locally it may look like the system is going in circle, but the higher order terms may take over and make the system spiral in or out.
