In the context of ODE, use x as a function of time
$x(t)$, sometimes shortened to simply $x$

Derivatives with respect to time
$\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=\dot{x}(t)$ shortened to $\dot{x}$

$n^{th}$ derivative
$\frac{d^n}{dt^n}x(t)=x^{(n)}(t)=x^{(n)}$

Constant coefficients (e.g. [[Homogeneous DE#Constant coefficient homogeneous differential equation|constant coefficient homo DE]])
$a_i$ 

Coefficients for combination of solutions ([[Linear ODE#Principle of Superposition|superposition]])
$c_i$

Coefficients that are functions of some other variable
$f_i()$
