To analyze the motion of a body, we need to consider all the forces acting on it:
- Acceleration due to gravity
- Negative acceleration due to wind resistance
- Negative acceleration due to friction with the surface (if not completely vertical) [[../Definitions/Frictional Force|Frictional Force]]
- (Negative) acceleration due to external force


The following gif is showing acceleration due to gravity (blue) and friction due to contact with the surface (green). [[Horizontal Motion]] and [[Inclined Motion]] considers the friction.
