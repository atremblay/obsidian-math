Analysing the motion of a body or a particule will use [[../../Newtons's Laws/Second Law#Second law|Newton's second law]] 

$$F=ma=m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2} \tag{1.1}$$
and [[../../Newtons's Laws/Second Law#Law of attraction|the law of attraction]]
$$F=k\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2} \tag{1.12}$$

## Vertical Motion

$M$ = mass of the earth, assumed to be a sphere
$m$ = mass of a body in the earth's gravitational field
$R$ = the radius of the earth
$x$ = the distance of the body above the earth's surface


> [!blank-container|right-medium]
> ![[../Images/earth_gravity.svg|400]]

By (1.12), the force of attraction between earth and body is (we assume their masses are concentrated at their respective centers) 
$$F=-G\frac{Mm}{(R+x)^2} \tag{1.13}$$
The proportionality constant $G$ which we have used in place of $k$ is called the **gravitational constant**. The negative sign is necessary because the resulting force acts downward toward the earth's center, and our positive direction is upward. If $x \ll R$ then
$$F\approx-G\frac{Mm}{R^2} \tag{1.14}$$

> [!NOTE]- The error in writing (1.14) is small 
> $R$ =4000 miles approximately so that even if $x$ is as high as 1 mile above the earth, the difference between using $(4000 \times 5280)^2$ feet and $(4001 \times 5280)^2$  feet in the denominator is relatively negligible.
> Because of this we typically drop the approximation $\approx$ and use a simple $=$

By combining (1.1) and (1.12) we can write 
$$m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = F = -G\frac{Mm}{R^2} \tag{1.15}$$
Since $G$, $M$ and $R$ are constants, we may replace $GM/R^2$ by a new constant which we call $g$. We thus finally obtain for the differential equation of motion of a falling body in the gravitational field of the earth,
$$\cancel{m}\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -g\cancel{m}, \hspace{1em} \cancel{m}\frac{dv}{dt}=-g\cancel{m},\tag{1.16}$$



where $v=\frac{dx}{dt}$. The minus sign is necessary because we have taken the upward direction as positive and the force of the earth's attraction is downward. From (1.16), we have
$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -g\tag{1.17}$$
The constant $g$ is thus the acceleration of a body due to the earth's attractive force, commonly known as the **force of gravity**. Its value varies slightly for different locations on the earth and for different heights. For convenience we shall use the value $32 ft/sec^2$.
Integration of (1.17) gives the velocity equation
$$v=\frac{dx}{dt}=-gt+c_1\tag{1.18}$$
and by integration of (1.18), we obtain the distance equation 
$$x(t)=-\frac{gt^2}{2} + c_1t + c_2 \tag{1.2}$$

> [!blank-container|right-small]
> ![[../Images/gravity_ex1.svg|300]]

The force of the air resistance is given as $(m/40)v$. The downward force due to the weight of the mass $m$ is $mg$ pounds. Hence the differential equation of motion (1.16) must be modified to read, with the *positive direction downward* (remember mass X acceleration of a body = the net forces acting upon it),
$$\cancel{m}\frac{dv}{dt}=g\cancel{m}-\frac{\cancel{m}}{40}v$$
Note that the force of gravity $gm$ is now positive since it acts in the chosen positive direction.

Given that the formula for speed with respect to time is 
$$v(t) = 40g(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{40}})$$
We just need to integrate it with respect to time to get the position
$$
\begin{align}
\int v(t) dt &= \int 40g(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{40}}) dt \\
\int \frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} dt &= \int 40g \mathrm{d}t - \int 40g e^{-\frac{t}{40}} dt \\
s &= 40g(t + C_1) + 40^2g( e^{-\frac{t}{40}} +C_2) \\
&= 40gt + 40^2ge^{-\frac{t}{40}} + C \\
&= 40g(t + 40e^{-\frac{t}{40}}) + C \\
\end{align}
$$

Since the positive direction is downward, we will chose the origin to be where the ball is dropped. So at $t=0$ the initial position $s(0)=0$  
$$
\begin{align}
s(0) = 0 &= 40g(0 + 40e^{-\frac{0}{40}}) + C \\
&= 1600g + C \\
\iff C &= - 1600g 
\end{align}
$$
Formula for the position is 
$$
\begin{align}
s(t) &= 40g(t + 40e^{-\frac{t}{40}}) - 1600g\\
&=40g(t + 40e^{-\frac{t}{40}} - 40) 
\end{align}$$
The body will reach the ground when $s(t) = 0$
$$
\begin{align}
s(t) = 0 &=40g(t + 40e^{-\frac{t}{40}} - 40) + 5000 \\
\frac{-5000}{40g} + 40 &=t + 40e^{-\frac{t}{40}}
\end{align}
$$

The ball cannot go lower than the ground. No idea how to solve this one above, but the dotted line is the maximum "height" at some time $t$.

Note that the returning velocity is less than the initial velocity $v_{0}$. To find the time of descent, use the formula for $y$ as found in problem 22. Here it is not easy to see that the time of descent is longer than the time of ascent.

Solve independently and then check your results with the formulas found in problems 22 and 23.

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
>  A man and his parachute weigh $192 \mathrm{lb}$. Assume that a safe landing velocity is $16 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$ and that air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity, equaling $1 \mathrm{lb}$ for each square foot of cross-sectional area of the parachute when it is moving at $20 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$ at right angles to the direction of motion. What must the cross-sectional area of a parachute be in order that the paratrooper land safely? Hint. First find the force of the air resistance. Then find $k$ such that T.V. $=16$. Then find the number of square feet of parachute that will make the force of the air resistance equal to $k v^{2}$.


##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
>  With what velocity must a rocket be fired in order to reach a height of 400 $\mathrm{mi}$ above the earth; $4000 \mathrm{mi}$ above the earth? Solve independently. Check your results with (h) of Example 16.36 .[^4]

[^4]:assume no air resistance and that the object is far enough from the earth so that equation (16.35) applies. Use the following data: $R=4000$ miles, $g=32 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}, \sqrt{2 g R}=6.96 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{sec}$.

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
>  The "air" $200 \mathrm{mi}$ above the earth is so thin that it will hardly slow a space vehicle. It is called the $\mathbf{F}-2$ region of the atmosphere. What velocity should a rocket have at 200 milcs above the earth, if all its fuel is exhausted at that point, in order to go another $3800 \mathrm{mi}$ ?[^4]

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
> A body is shot to a height of $400 \mathrm{mi}$ and then starts to fall. What is its velocity (a) when it has fallen $200 \mathrm{mi}$ and (b) when it is at the surface of the earth? Hint. Use (a) of Example 16.38 with $r_{0}=R+400=4400$. Note that the velocity, when it reaches the ground, is the same as the velocity required to propel it 400 miles upward. See problem 31.[^4]

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
> Assume a body fals from rest at a distance of $61 R$, i.e., at a distance of $244,000 \mathrm{mi}$ from the center of the earth (equivalent to the moon's distance from the center of the earth). With what velocity and in how many hours will it reach the earth? 35. A body is fired straight up with an initial velocity equal to the escape velocity $\sqrt{2 g R}$. Find:[^4]

> [!Example] (a)
> The velocity of the projectile as a function of the distance $r$ from the center of the earth.

> [!Example] (c)
> When it will have reached $244,000 \mathrm{mi}$, the distance of the moon from the center of the earth.

Hint. Use (e) and (q) of Example 16.36.

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
> A body is fired straight up with an initial velocity $v_{0}$ whose magnitude is less than escape velocity. When will it reach its maximum height? Hint. The maximum height the body will reach is given in (h) of Example 16.36. Express this value of $r$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ as defined in (j). Then use (m) and $(\mathrm{n})$. NoÑ‚Ðµ. This time equation is valid only for a rising particle. If you wish to compute its return time, you must use the time equation given in (d) of Example 16.38, with $r_{0}$ equal to the height from which it begins its fall.[^4]

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
> Show that if $v_{0}$ is very much less than the escape velocity $\sqrt{2 g R}$, then the time for the object to reach its maximum height, as given in problem 36 , is approximately $v_{0} / g$. Hint. Replace the Arc sin function by its series expansion, Arc $\sin x=x+x^{3} / 6+\cdots$. Then eliminate $v_{0}^{2}$ and higher powers of $v_{0}$. To see some justification for this elimination, let $v_{0}=\frac{1}{30}$ $\mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{sec}$ in the time equation of problem 36 .[^4]

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
> A body is shot straight up from the surface of the moon with an initial velocity $v_{0}$. (a) Find the velocity $v$ of the body as a function of its distance $r_{m}$ from the center of the moon. (b) Find the escape velocity of the body. The radius of the moon is approximately $1080 \mathrm{mi}$; the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the moon is approximately one-sixth that of the earth. Take the outward direction from the moon as positive.[^4]

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
> (a) Prove that if a particle were placed approximately nine-tenths of the distance $D$ from the center of the earth to the center of the moon on a line connecting moon to earth, Fig. 16.392, the particle would be at rest, i.e., the gravitational pulls of moon and earth on a particle placed nine-tenths of the distance from the center of earth to the center of the moon are equal. Assume the mass of the moon is $1 / 81$ the mass of the earth. Hint. Apply (16.32) to both earth and moon. Then equate the two forces.[^4]

> [!Example] (b)
> Set up the differential equation of motion of a particle shot from the surface of the earth toward the moon, considered fixed, taking into account both the earth's and moon's gravitational attractions. Solve the equation with $t=0, v=v_{0}$. Take the positive direction as outward from the earth, and the orgin at the earth's center.

> [!Example] (c)
> At what velocity must the particle be fired in order to reach the neutral point? Hint. In the velocity equation found in (b), you want $v=0$, when $r=\frac{9}{10} D$. Assume $R_{m}^{2}=6 R^{2} / 81, D=61 R+R / 4$, $g_{m}=g / 6$, where $R_{m}$ is the radius of the moon and $g_{m}$ is the acceleration due to the force of gravity of the moon. Note the small effect of the moon's gravitational attraction.

> [!Example] (d)
> At what velocity must a projectile be fired in order to reach the moon?

##### Example
#example 
> [!Example] Statement
>  If a body were dropped in a hole bored through the center of the earth, it would be attracted toward the center with a force directly proportional to the distance of the body from the center.

> [!Example] (a)
> With what velocity will it pass the center?

> [!Example] (b)
> When will it reach the other end of the hole?

NoÑ‚E. The motion of the body is known as simple harmonic motion. A fuller discussion of this motion can be found in Lesson 28.
