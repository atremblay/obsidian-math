#### Single variable

If to each value of an independant variable *x* on a [set](Set.md) *E* (*the set must be specified*) there corresponds one and only one real value of the dependant variable *y*, we say that the dependent variable *y* is **function** of the independant variable *x* on the set *E*.

#### More than two variable

The above definition can be easily expanded for two independant variables (or more).

If to each element *(x,y)* of a set *E* in the plane (the set must be sepcified) there corresponds one and only one real value of x, then *z* is said to be a function of *x* and *y* for the set *E*. In this even, *x,y* are called independant varaibles and *z* a dependent variable.

#### Domain and Range

The set *E* is called the **domain** *D* (the values the independent variables can take) and the **range** *R* (or **image**) the corresponding values the dependent variable takes. 

> To each value in the domain, there is one and only one corresponding value in the range

A function is not necessarily an equation. It could simply be a rule that match one value of the independent variable to one value of the dependent variable.
