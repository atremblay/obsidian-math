The coefficients can be functions of some variable (here $x$). 

> [!important]- 
> Notice that every term has an $n^{th}$ derivative, there is no constant term. If there is a constant term, then it becomes a [[Linear ODE#Nonhomogeneous|non-homogeneous]] DE.

$$f_n(y)x^{(n)}+f_{n-1}(y)x^{(n-1)}+\ldots+f_1(y)\dot{x}+f_0(y)x=0$$

## Constant coefficient homogeneous differential equation

Among the easiest DE to solve is the case where the coefficients are constants $a_i$
$$a_nx^{(n)}+a_{n-1}x^{(n-1)}+\ldots+a_1\dot{y}+a_0x=0$$
