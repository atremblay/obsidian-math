A set is a collection of **unique** elements. They don't have to be continuous.

### Interval

The *set of all numbers* between any two points on a line is called an **interval** and is usually denoted by the letter *I*.

- *I*: $-\infty \lt x \lt \infty$ means the set of all real values of x
- *I*: $a \le x \le b$ means the set of all real values of x between a and b, inclusive
- *I*: $-1 \lt x \lt 3, x=10$ is the set of all real values of x between a and b, exclusive, plus the value 10

You get the idea.
