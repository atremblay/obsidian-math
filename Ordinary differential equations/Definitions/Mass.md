Mass is not weight. 
$$\text{weight}=\text{mass}\times \text{gravity}$$
Weight is actually the force applied by gravity on a mass. This is [[../../Newtons's Laws/Second Law|Newton's Second Law]]

- Mass unit can be kilograms, pounds or any other units of measure.
- Weight is in Netwon

In common everyday language, people often use the term "kilogram" to refer to their weight, but technically speaking, a kilogram is a unit of mass, not weight. 

In the scientific and international standard (SI) context, the unit of weight is the newton (N), which is a force. This comes from the definition of weight as the force exerted by gravity on an object, which equals mass (in kilograms) times acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2 on the surface of the Earth). So, if you have a mass of 1 kilogram, your weight on Earth would be approximately 9.8 newtons. 

However, because the acceleration due to gravity is relatively constant on the surface of the Earth, in everyday life it's simpler to measure mass directly (in kilograms) and use that as a proxy for weight. But remember, if you were to go to a place with a different gravitational field (like the Moon or Mars), your weight (in newtons) would change, while your mass (in kilograms) would stay the same.
