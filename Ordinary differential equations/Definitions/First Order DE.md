A common and specific form of a first-order differential equation is the linear first-order differential equation, which can be written as:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} + P(t)x = Q(t)
$$
where:
- $P(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are functions of $t$,
- $x$ is the function of $t$ that we're trying to find,
- and $dx/dt$ represents the derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$.

First-order differential equations are widely used in physics, engineering, economics, biology, and many other fields because they often naturally describe rate processes - that is, how things change over time.
