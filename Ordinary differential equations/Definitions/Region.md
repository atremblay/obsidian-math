A set in the plane is called a **region** if it satisfies the following two conditions:

1. Each point of the [set](Set.md) is the center of a circle whose entire interior consists of points in the set
2. Every two points of the set can be joined by a curve which consists entirely of points of the set


First condition excludes any [interval](Set.md####Interval) that includes its boudaries. If you take a point at the boudary, then a circle around it, not matter how small it is, will include points that are outside the set.

Second conditions means that two disconnected sets do not form a region. e.g. $1 \lt x \lt 2, 3 \lt x \lt 4$ cannot be qualified as a region because a point between 1 and 2 cannot be joined to a point between 3 and 4. It makes more sense if we think in more than one dimension.

A region is said to be **bounded** if there is a circle which will enclose it.
