A common and specific form of a second-order differential equation is the linear second-order differential equation, which can be written as:
$$
x'' + P(t)x' + Q(t)x = R(t)
$$

where:

- $P(t)$, $Q(t)$, and $R(t)$ are functions of $t$,
- $x$ is the function of $t$ that we're trying to find,
- $x'$ represents the first derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$, and
- $x''$ represents the second derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$.

Second-order differential equations appear frequently in many areas of science and engineering, such as physics (particularly in mechanics and wave motion), electrical engineering (in circuit analysis), and many others.
