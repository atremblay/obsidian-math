> [!definition] Frictional Force of a Body 
> The frictional force of a body moving on a surface is, by definition, equal to the product of the coefficient of friction $\mu$ of the body and the normal (as in normal to a plane) gravitational force $m g\sin(\theta)$
> $$\mu(m g\sin\theta)$$
> where $\theta$ is the angle between the surface and the ground.

If a body moves in a horizontal direction, as on a table or platform, a frictional force develops, which operates to stop the progress of the motion. This frictional force is due to

1. The [[../../Newtons's Laws/Second Law|Gravitational Force]] of the earth pressing the body to the platform $mg$
2. The [[../Definitions/Coefficient of Friction|coefficient of friction]] of the surface $\mu$
 

 From experience we know that it requires a greater force to begin the movement of an object than it does to keep it moving. There are thus two coefficients of friction, one called static friction, which operates at the start of the motion, the other called sliding friction, which operates after the motion has begun.

The frictional force of a body moving on a surface is **proportional** to the force of gravity on the body $mg$. If the body is heavier or the gravity bigger, then it stands to reason that the friction will be bigger. The proportionality constant is $\mu$. So the frictional force of a body is
$$\mu (mg)$$

If the surface is not horizontal to the ground, then only a portion of the gravitational force will affect cause the friction. It's always the portion that is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. The component normal to the surface is $g\sin(\theta)$, so the frictional force is
$$\mu(mg\sin\theta)$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between the surface and the ground.
