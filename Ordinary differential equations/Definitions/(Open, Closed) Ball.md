> [!definition] Open Ball
> An open ball with center $x^{0} \in R^{n}$ and radius $\rho>0$ is the set of points in $R^{n}$ which are at a distance less than $\rho$ from $x^{0}$,
> 
> $$
> B\left(x^{0}, \rho\right)=\left\{x: x \in R^{n}, d\left(x, x^{0}\right)<\rho\right\} . \tag{1}
> $$

(1) is an [[(Open, Closed) Set|open set]]

> [!definition] Closed Ball
> The corresponding closed ball is
> 
> $$
> \bar{B}\left(x^{0}, \rho\right)=\left\{x: x \in R^{n}, d\left(x, x^{0}\right) \leqq \rho\right\} \tag{2}
> $$

(2) is a [[(Open, Closed) Set|closed set]]

> [!definition] Surface of a Ball
> The surface of this ball, called a sphere, is

> S\left(x^{0}, \rho\right)=\left\{x: x \in R^{n}, d\left(x, x^{0}\right)=\rho\right\} . \tag{3}

> [!definition] (Ball) Neighborhood
> 
> ![[(Open, Closed) Set#^3c19bf]]
> 
> - All open balls centered at a point $x^{0}$ are neighborhoods of $x^{0}$
> - A point has neighborhoods which are arbitrarily small.
