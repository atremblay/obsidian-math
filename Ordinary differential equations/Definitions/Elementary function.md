Elementary [[Function|functions]] are constants and the following functions of a variable $x$:

1. Powers of $x: x, x^2, x^n$
2. Roots of $x: \sqrt{x}, \sqrt[3]{x}, \sqrt[n]{x}$
3. Exponentials: $e^x$
4. Logarithms: $\log{x}$
5. Trigonometric functions: $\sin{x}, \cos{x}, \tan{x}, etc$
6. Inverse trigonometric functions: $\arcsin{x}, \arccos{x}, etc$
7. All functions obtained by replacing  $x$ any number of times by any of the other functions 1 to 6: $\log{\sin{x}}, \sin{\sin{x}}$
8. All functions obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing any of the above seven types of a finite number of times.
