Given the generic DE
$$\sum_{i=0}^n f_i(x)y^{(i)}=Q(x)$$

the homogeneous version of it
$$\sum_i f_i(x)y^{(i)}=0$$
has $n$ linearly independant solutions $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n$ and their linear combination ($c_i$ are constants) 
$$y_c=\sum c_iy_i$$ 
is the **complementary function**. $y_h$ is also used as notation because it's the [[../../Calculus/General solution]] to the homogeneous version
