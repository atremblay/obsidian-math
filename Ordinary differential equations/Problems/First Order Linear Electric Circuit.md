The differential equation which results when an applied electromotive force $E$, an inductor $L$, and a resistor $R$ are connected in series is, Fig. 17.621,

$$
L \frac{d i}{d t}+R i=E
$$

For an understanding of this equation and for the meaning of these terms, read Lesson 30 . The units we shall adopt are

ohms for the coefficient of resistance of the resistor, henries for the coefficient of inductance of the inductor, volts for the electromotive force (also written as emf), amperes for the current.

7. Solve the differential equation (17.63), if $E=E_{0}$ and at $l=0$, the current $i=i_{0}$. What is the limiting current as $t \rightarrow \infty$ ?
8. Solve (17.63) if $E=E_{0} \sin \omega t$ and at $t=0, i=i_{0}$.
9. An inductance of 3 henries and a resistance of $30 \mathrm{ohms}$ are connected in series with an emf of 150 volts. At $t=0, i=0$. Find the current when $t=0.01$ sec.
10. An inductance of 2 henries and a resistance of $20 \mathrm{ohms}$ are connected in series with an emf of $100 \sin 150 t$ volts. At $t=0, i=0$. Find the current when $t=0.01$ sec.
11. When an emf is disconnected from a circuit in which a current is flowing, i.e., at $t=0, E=0$, the current is called an induced current. The term $L d i / d t$ is then referred to as an induced electromotive force. At the moment an emf is disconnected from a circuit in which there is a resistance of $30 \mathrm{ohms}$ and an inductance of 6 henries, the current $i=15 \mathrm{amp}$. (a) Find the current equation as a function of time. (b) When will the current be $7.5 \mathrm{amp}$ ?
