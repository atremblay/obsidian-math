When water flows from a tank through a small hole in its bottom, it has been proved that the rate of flow of water is proportional to the area of the hole and the square root of the height of the water in the tank. Hence

$$
\frac{d V}{d t}=-k a \sqrt{h}, \quad d V=-k a \sqrt{h} d t
$$

where $V$ is the number of cubic feet of water in the tank at time $t$ seconds, $k$ is a positive proportionality constant, $a$ is the area of the hole in square feet, $h$ is the height in feet of the water above the hole at time $t$.

The minus sign is necessary because the volume of water is decreasing. If $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the water surface at time $t$, then $d V=A d h$. Substituting this value of $d V$ in the second equation of (17.6) and taking $k=4.8$, a figure determined experimentally as valid under certain conditions, we obtain

$$
A d h=-4.8 a \sqrt{h} d t, \quad A h^{-1 / 2} d h=-4.8 \pi r^{2} d t,
$$

where

- $A$ is the cross-sectional area in square feet of the water surface at time $t$ sec,
- $h$ is the height in feet of the water level above the hole or orifice at time $t$,
- $r$ is the radius in feet of the orifice. With the aid of (17.61), solve the following problems.

## Example
1. A tank, whose cross section measures $3 \mathrm{ft} \times 4 \mathrm{ft}$, is filled with water to a height of $9 \mathrm{ft}$. It has a hole at the bottom of radius $1 \mathrm{in}$. (a) When will the tank be empty? (b) When will the water be $5 \mathrm{ft}$ high? Hint. At $t=0$, $h=9$ and in (17.61) $r=\frac{1}{12}, A=12$.
2. A water container, whose circular cross section is $6 \mathrm{ft}$ in diameter and whose height is $8 \mathrm{ft}$, is filled with water. It has a hole at the bottom of radius 1 in. When will the tank be empty?
3. Solve problem 2 if the tank rests on supports above ground so that its $8 \mathrm{ft}$ height is now in a horizontal direction, Fig. 17.62, and the hole of radius $1 \mathrm{in}$. is in its bottom.

4. A water tank, in the shape of a conical funnel, with its apex at the bottom and vertical axis, is $12 \mathrm{ft}$ across the top and $18 \mathrm{ft}$ high. It has a hole at its apex of radius $1 \mathrm{in}$. When will the tank be empty if initially it is filled with water?
5. A water tank, in the shape of a paraboloid of revolution, measures $6 \mathrm{ft}$ in diameter at the top and is $3 \mathrm{ft}$ deep. A hole at the bottom is 1 in. in diameter. When will the tank be empty if initially it is filled with water?
6. A cylindrical tank is $12 \mathrm{ft}$ in diameter and $9 \mathrm{ft}$ high. Water flows into the tank at the rate of $\pi / 10 \mathrm{ft}^{3} / \mathrm{sec}$. It has a hole of radius $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{in}$. at the bottom. When will the tank be full if initially it is empty? Hint. Adjust the first equation in (17.6) to reflect the increase in volume due to the water intake. Remember $d V=A d h$. After simplification, you should obtain

$$
\int_{h=0}^{9} \frac{d h}{12-\sqrt{h}}=\frac{1}{4320} \int_{t=0}^{t} d t .
$$
