When a rope or chain, assumed uniform, flexible, and inextensible, is wound around a rough cylindrical post, a small force applied at one end of the rope or chain can control a much larger force applied at the other end. For example, a man can hold in check a large weight by winding a rope attached to it, a sufficient number of times about a pole.

For a post, whose axis is horizontal, it has been proved that the differential equation

$$
\frac{d T}{d \theta}=\delta r(\cos \theta+\mu \sin \theta)+\mu T
$$

expresses the tension $T$ in the rope or chain at a point $P$ on it, when the rope or chain is just on the verge of slipping, see Fig. 17.71. In equation (17.7),

$T$ is the pull or tension on the rope at any point $P$ on it, in pounds, $r$ is the radius of the cylinder, in feet,

$\mu$ is the coefficient of friction between rope and post,

$\delta$ is the weight of the rope or chain in pounds per foot, $\theta$ is the radial angle of $P$.

With the help of (17.7), solve the following problems.

18. Show that the solution of (17.7) is

$$
T=\frac{\delta r}{1+\mu^{2}}\left[\left(1-\mu^{2}\right) \sin \theta-2 \mu \cos \theta\right]+c e^{\mu \theta} .
$$

19. A chain weighs $\delta \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}$. It hangs over a circular cylinder with horizontal axis and radius $r \mathrm{ft}$. One end of the chain is at $A$, Fig. 17.71. How far must the other end extend below $D$, so that the chain is on the verge of slipping. Hint. The initial conditions are: $\theta=0, T=0$, and $\theta=\pi, T=l \delta$, where $l$ is the length of the portion of the chain overhanging at $D$.
20. A chain weighs $\delta \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}$. It hangs over a circular cylinder with horizontal axis and radius $r \mathrm{ft}$. One end of the chain is at $B$, Fig. 17.71, the other end just reaches to $D$. What is the least value of $\mu$ so that the chain will not slip? Hint. The initial conditions are: $\theta=\pi / 2, T=0$, and if the chain is not to slip, then at $\theta=\pi$, $T=0$.
21. A chain weighs $1 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}$. It hangs over $\mathrm{a}$ circular cylinder with horizontal axis and radius $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{ft}$. One end of the chain reaches three quarters around the top to $C$, Fig. 17.71; the other end extends below $D$. The coefficient of friction between chain and cylinder is $\frac{1}{2}$. If the chain is on the verge of slipping, find the length $l$ of the overhang.
22. If the axis of the cylinder is vertical, then

Figure 17.71 the rope's or chain's weight which now acts vertically so that it does not press down upon the cylinder, has little effective force. Hence, in formula (17.7), $\delta$ which is the weight per unit length of rope, may be taken to be zero. The formula then simplifies to

$$
\frac{d T}{d \theta}=\mu T .
$$

With the help of (17.73), solve the following problem. A longshoreman is holding a ship by means of a hawser wound around a vertical post. The ship is pulling on the rope with a force of 5 tons. If the coefficient of friction between rope and post is $\frac{1}{3}$, and the man exerts a force of $50 \mathrm{lb}$ to hold the ship, approximately how many turns of rope is he using? Hint. Initial condition is $\theta=0, T=50$. We want $\theta$ when $T=10,000$.
