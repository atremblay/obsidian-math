I worked a lot on that example, asking myself all kinds of questions. It started to get long and Obsidian had trouble rendering all the formulas and `Tikz` graphics, so I split it all in different files.


## Statement
A pilot always keeps the nose of his plane pointed toward a city T due west of his starting point. If his speed is $v$ miles per hour and a wind is blowing from the south at the rate of $w$ miles per hour, find the equation of the plane's path. Assume that it starts from a flying field which is at a distance $a$ miles from $T$.

The wind is either vertical or at an angle.

### Vertical Wind
- [[Vertical Wind > Cartesian|Solution in Cartesian Coordinates]]
    - [[Vertical Wind > Cartesian#Case 1.|Case 1]]
    - [[Vertical Wind > Cartesian#Case 2.|Case 2]]
    - [[Vertical Wind > Cartesian#Case 3|Case 3]]
    - [[Vertical Wind > Cartesian#Flip the script|Flip the script]]
- [[Vertical Wind > Polar|Solution in Polar Coordinates]]


### Wind direction at an angle
- [[Wind direction at an angle > Cartesian|Solution in Cartesian Coordinates]]
    - [[Wind direction at an angle > Cartesian#Method 1|Method 1]]
    - [[Wind direction at an angle > Cartesian#Method 2|Method 2]]
- [[Wind direction at an angle > Polar|Solution in Polar Coordinates]]
