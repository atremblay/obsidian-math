Solve problems 23-27 below, by use of Newton's law of motion $F=m a=m v(d v / d y)$, where $F$ is the algebraic sum of all the forces acting on a body of mass $m$, and $a$ is the acceleration of the center of gravity of the body.

23. A 24-ft chain weighing $\delta \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}$ hangs over a frictionless support, which is more than $24 \mathrm{ft}$ above the floor. Initially the chain is held at rest with $10 \mathrm{ft}$ overhanging on one side of the support and $14 \mathrm{ft}$ on the other side, Fig. 17.74.

How long after its release and with what velocity will the chain leave the support? Hint. When $12 \mathrm{ft}$ of shain overhang on each side of the support, the chain is in equilibrium. Call this position $y=0$. Then if the distance of one end of the chain from equilibrium is $y$, the distance of the other end is $-y$. The effective force moving the chain is therefore $2 y \delta$. The mass of the chain is $24 \delta / 32$. Initial conditions are $\ell=0, v=0, y=2$.

24. In problem 23 , assume that the $14-\mathrm{ft}$ overhang just touches the floor. Compute the velocity with which the other end will leave the support.
25. A chain is $12 \mathrm{ft}$ long. Six feet of the chain are held extended on a frictionless flat table which is more than $12 \mathrm{ft}$ above the ground, the other $6 \mathrm{ft}$ hangs over the table. When and with what velocity will the end of the chain leave the table after its release? Hint. $m=12 \delta / 32, F=y \delta$, where $y$ is the distance of the overhanging part of the chain from the edge of the table and $\delta$ is its weight per foot. Initial conditions are $t=0, y=6, v=0$.
26. Assume, in problem 25 , that the table is only $4 \mathrm{ft}$ above the ground. With what velocity will the chain of problem 25 leave the table?
27. It has been proved that when a mass particle slides without friction down a fixed curved path whose equation is $y=f(x)$, its differential equation of motion, with upward direction positive, is

$$
v d v=-g d y,
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $v$ is the velocity of the particle along the curve, and $y$ is the vertical position of the particle at time $t$. Therefore, $v=d s / d t$, where $s$ is the distance the particle has moved along the curved path. Show that the solution of (17.75), with initial conditions $t=0$, $v=v_{0}, y=y_{0}$, is

$$
v^{2}=\left(\frac{d s}{d l}\right)^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 g\left(y_{0}-y\right) .
$$

By means of the substitution in (17.76) of $d s / d t=\sqrt{1+(d y / d x)^{2}} d x / d t$, the equation of the path $y=f(x)$ and the initial condition $y_{0}=f\left(x_{0}\right)$, show that (17.76) becomes

$$
\left(\frac{d x}{d t}\right)^{2}=\frac{v_{0}^{2}+2 g\left[f\left(x_{0}\right)-f(x)\right]}{1+\left[f^{\prime}(x)\right]^{2}} .
$$

The solution of (17.77) will give $x$ as a function of $t$. With $x$ known, we can determine $y$ by means of the given equation of the path $y=f(x)$.

Use (17.77) to solve the following problem. A particle moves along a smooth wire, shaped in the form of the parabola $x^{2}=-y$. Initially it is at the origin and has a velocity of $4 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$. Find the position of the particle at the end of 5 sec. Hint. $f(x)=-x^{2}, f\left(x_{0}\right)=0, f^{\prime}(x)=-2 x$.
