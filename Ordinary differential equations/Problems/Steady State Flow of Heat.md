When the inner and outer walls of a body, as for example the inner and outer walls of a house or of a pipe, are maintained at different constant temperatures, heat will flow from the warmer wall to the colder one. When each surface parallel to a wall has attained a constant temperature, we say that the flow of heat has reached a steady state. In a steady state flow of heat, therefore, each surface parallel to a wall, because its temperature is now constant, is called an isothermal surface. Isothermal surfaces at different distances from an interior wall will, of course, have different temperatures. In many cases the temperature of an isothermal surface is a function only of its distance $x$ from an interior wall, and the rate of flow of heat in a unit time across such a surface is proportional both to the area of the surface and to $d T / d x$, where $T$ is the temperature of the isothermal surface. Hence

$$
Q=-k A \frac{d T}{d x}
$$

where

$Q$ is the rate of flow of calories* of heat in 1 sec across an isothermal surface,

$k$, the proportionality constant, is called the thermal conductivity of the material that is between the walls,

A calorie is equal to the amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree centigrade. $A$ is the area in square centimeters of an isothermal surface, $T$ is the temperature in centigrade degrees of the isothermal surface, $x$ is the distance in centimeters of the isothermal surface from an interior wall.

The negative sign is used to indicate that heat flows from the interior wall of higher temperature to the exterior wall of lower temperature.

With the help of (17.64), solve the following problems.

12. The inner and outer radii of a hollow spherical shell are $4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $9 \mathrm{~cm}$ respectively. The thermal conductivity of the material between the walls is $0.75 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{deg}-\mathrm{cm}$-sec. The inner surface is kept at a constant temperature of $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the outer surface at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find:

(a) The rate of heat loss per second flowing outward through the exterior of the shell.

(b) The temperature $T$ of a surface $5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the center.

Hint. In (17.64) $A=4 \pi r^{2}$, where $r$, which replaces $x$ in the formula, is the radius of an isothermal surface. Initial conditions are: $r=4, r=100$; $r=9, T=0$.

Note, from answer, that $Q$ has a constant value. In this example, it is $2160 \pi \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{sec}$. Hence, through each isothermal surface, this much heat escapes each second. If a surface is nearer the center of the sphere, so that its area is smaller than the area of a surface farther away, more heat per unit area will escape each second from the nearer surface than from the farther one. The total loss of heat through each surface is, however, the same.

13. A steam pipe of negligible thickness has an inside radius of $6 \mathrm{~cm}$. It is insulated with $3 \mathrm{~cm}$ coating of magnesia, whose thermal conductivity is 0.000175 . The interior of the pipe is maintained at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the outer surface at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find:

(a) The rate of heat loss per second flowing outward from each meter length of pipe.

(b) The temperature of an isothermal surface whose radius is $8 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Hint. In (17.64), $A=2 \pi r(100)$, where $r$, which replaces $x$ in the formula, is the radius of an isothermal surface.
