In the straight line motion problems thus far considered, the mass of a particle or of a body remained constant throughout the motion. If, however, the mass itself is also changing with time, decreasing or increasing, then Newton's second law of motion no longer holds and must be modified. It has been proved, in the case of a body of variable mass moving in a straight line, that the differential equation governing its motion is given by

$$
m \frac{d v}{d t}=F+u \frac{d m}{d t}
$$

where

$m$ is the mass of the body at time $t$, $v$ is the velocity of the body at time $t$,

$F$ is the algebraic sum of all the forces acting on the body at time $t$, $d m$ is the mass joining or leaving the body in the time interval $d t$, $u$ is the velocity of $d m$ at the moment it joins or leaves the body, relative to an observer stationed on the body.

Note that (17.78) differs from Newton's second law of motion by the term $u d m / d t$.

If a mass $d m$ leaves the system in the time interval $d t, d m / d t$ will be a negative quantity; if it joins the system, $d m / d t$ will be a positive quantity.

With the aid of (17.78), solve the following problems.

28. A rocket, which weighs $32 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{lb}$ and contains fuel weighing $32 m_{0} \mathrm{lb}$, is propelled straight up from the surface of the earth by burning $32 k \mathrm{lb}$ of fuel per second and expelling it backwards at a constant velocity of $A \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$ relative to an observer on the rocket. Assume that the only force acting on the rocket is that of gravity. Find the velocity of the rocket and the distance it travels as functions of time. Take positive direction upward. Hint. In (17.78), the variable mass $m$ at time $t$ is $m=M+m_{0}-k t$; therefore $d m / d t=-k$. The relative velocity $u$ of $d m$ is $-A$. The force of gravity at time $t$ is $F=$ $-\left(M+m_{0}-k t\right) g$. Answers are

$$
v=-g t-A \log \left(1-\frac{k}{M+m_{0}} t\right), 0 \leqq t<\frac{M+m_{0}}{k},
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=A t-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}+\frac{A}{k}\left(M+m_{0}-k t\right) \log \left(1-\frac{k}{M+m_{0}} t\right) \\
0 \leqq t<\frac{M+m_{0}}{k} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Nore. If the rocket moves in free space so that it is not subject to the gravitational force of the earth, then $F=0$ in (17.78) and $g=0$ in (17.79) and (17.8).

29. (a) Show that, when the rocket's fuel of problem 28 is exhausted, it has reached a theoretical height of

$$
y=\frac{A m_{0}}{k}-\frac{g}{2}\left(\frac{m_{0}}{k}\right)^{2}+\frac{A M}{k} \log \left(\frac{M}{M+m_{0}}\right) .
$$

Hint. The mass $m_{0}$ of the fuel will be exhausted in time $t=m_{0} / k$. Substitute this value in (17.8).

(b) Show that its velocity at that moment is

$$
v=-\frac{g m_{0}}{k}-A \log \left(\frac{M}{M+m_{0}}\right) \text {. }
$$

30. A rocket of mass $M$, containing fuel of mass $m_{0}$, falls to the earth from a great height. It burns an amount $k$ of its mass per second and ejects it downward with a constant velocity relative to an observer on the rocket of $A \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$. Find the distance it falls in time $t$. Take positive downward direction. Hint. See problem 28 .
31. A rocket and its fuel have mass $m_{0}$. At the moment it starts to burn an amount $k$ of its mass per second, it is moving with a velocity $v_{0}$. The fuel is ejected backwards with just enough velocity, so that the ejected fuel is motionless in space. Find the subsequent velocity and distance equations of the rocket as functions of time. Hint. For the ejected fuel to be motionless relative to an observer on the earth, the backward velocity of the fuel must equal the forward velocity of the rocket; remember, the fuel at the instant of ejection has the same forward velocity $v$ as the rocket itself. Relative to an observer on the rocket, however, it will seem to him as if he were standing still and the ejected fuel moving away from him at the rate of $-v \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$, where $+v \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$ is his own velocity in the positive direction. Therefore $u$ in (17.78) is $-v$. The variable mass $m=m_{0}-k t$ and $d m / d t=-k$.
32. Solve problem 31 if the rocket were moving in free space. Hint. $F=0$ in (17.78).
33. A body moves in a straight line in free space with a velocity of $v_{0} \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$. Initially its mass is $m_{0}$ and as it moves it adds to its mass $k$ slugs per second. Find its velocity and distance equations as functions of time. Hint. In $(17.78), F=0$ and assuming the added mass $d m$ is stationary in space, then its velocity relative to an observer on the body is $-v$, where $v$ is the velocity of the body. See problem 31 .
34. A spherical raindrop falls under the influence of gravity. Its mass increases by the addition of stationary moisture particles at a rate which is proportional to its surface area. Initially its radius $r=r_{0}$. Find its acceleration, velocity, and distance equations as functions of time. Take positive direction downward. Show that if initially $r_{0}=0$, the acceleration has the constant value $g / 4$. For hints, see answer section. First try to solve without making use of these hints.
35. A chain unwinds from coil held at rest. It falls straight down under the influence of gravity, which is the only acting force. Initially $l \mathrm{ft}$ of the chain are unwound. Find its velocity as a function of time. Take positive direction downward. For hints see answer section.
36. Solve problem 35 , if the chain must first slide along a frictionless plane inclined at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal before dropping straight down. Assume that the coil is held at rest at a distance $l \mathrm{ft}$ from one end of the plane and that initially one end of the chain is at the end of the plane. For hints, see answer section.
