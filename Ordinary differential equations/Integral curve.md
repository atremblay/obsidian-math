If $y=f(x)$ or $f(x,y)=0$ defines $y$ as a function of $x$ which satisfies $y'=F(x,y)$ on an interval $I$, then the graph of this function is called the integral curve. i.e. it is the graph of a function which is a solution of $y'=F(x,y)$

$$y=\int \frac{dy}{dx} dx = \int F(x,y) dx$$

At each point we have the slope of the "original" curve with $F(x,y)$. So $dy = F(x,y) dx$ is the amount by which $y$ changes when we take a tiny step $dx$. Simple application of $y=mx + b$.

See [[Direction Field]] for the source of this example. The lines below are three possible integral curves, depending on some initial conditions.
