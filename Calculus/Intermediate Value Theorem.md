a. Let $k$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then, since both $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ belong to the interval $f(I)=[m, M]$, so does $k$. Therefore $k$ is a value of $f$ taken at some point $c$ in the interval $[a, b]$. But $c$ cannot be one of the end points $a$ and $b$, since $k$ lies between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, and therefore cannot coincide with either $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.

b. This key property of continuous functions deserves a name of its own:

### Theorem
If $f$ is continuous in an interval $I$, which need not be closed, and if $f$ takes different values $f(\alpha)$ and $f(\beta)$ at two points $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of $I$, then $f$ takes every value between $f(\alpha)$ and $f(\beta)$ at some point between $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

#### Proof
In view of the preceding remarks, we need only show that $f$ is continuous in $[\alpha, \beta]$ if $\alpha<\beta$, or in $[\beta, \alpha]$ if $\beta<\alpha$. But, by hypothesis, $f$ is continuous in an interval $I$ containing $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Therefore $f$ is certainly continuous in the closed interval with end points $\alpha$ and $\beta$, since this is the smallest interval containing both $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
