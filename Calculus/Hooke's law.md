A mass is attached to a spring on an horizontal surface (no friction). Where the mass sits at rest is $x=0$. The mass is then pulled and release. What is the solution describing the motion of the mass over time?

> [!Important] Displacement
> Hooke's law uses the displacement from the equilibrium position. $x$ is the distance from the equilibrium. This is important for a system with more than 1 spring where the displacement on each mass is used.
