A critical point of a function $f$ is either a point where $f$ has no derivative or a point where the derivative of $f$ vanishes. According to the [[Local Extrema#Theorem|local extrema theorem]], if $f$ has a local extremum at $p$, then $p$ is a critical point of $f$. On the other hand, if $p$ is a critical point of $f$, there is no necessity for $f$ to have a local extremum at $p$. This is illustrated by Figure 8B, which shows two functions, each with a critical point at $p$, but neither with a local extremum at $p$.

Thus a critical point of $f$ is either a point where $f$ has no derivative or a [[Stationary Point|stationary point]] of $f$.
