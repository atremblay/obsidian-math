a. The properties of a function continuous in a closed interval (Sec. 2.65c) all stem from the following key proposition, whose proof is a bit too hard for a first course in calculus:

### Theorem
If $f$ is continuous in a closed interval $I=[a, b]$ and if $f$ is not a constant function, then the range of $f$, namely' the set of all values taken by $f$ at the points of $I$, is itself a closed interval.

This fact is expressed by saying that "a continuous function maps a closed interval into a closed interval," or that "the continuous image of a closed interval is a closed interval."

b. We must insist that $f$ be nonconstant, since the function $f(x) \equiv C$ maps $I$ into the single point $C$, hardly a closed interval! A function which is continuous in an open interval can map the interval into any other kind of interval, open, closed or half-open (see Prob. 10). Thus it is crucial to the validity of the theorem that the interval $I$ be closed. The set of values taken by $f$ at the points of $I$ will be denoted by $f(I)$. Do not think of $f(I)$ as the value of $f$ at $I$, which is meaningless. In fact, $f(I)$ is not a number, but rather the set $\{f(x): x \in I\}$.

c. What this means geometrically is shown in Figure 3, where the solid curve is the graph of a function $f$ continuous in a closed interval $I=[a, b]$. Suppose we drop perpendiculars from all the points of the curve $y=f(x)$ onto the $y$-axis. Then, according to our theorem, the resulting points completely "fill up" some closed interval $[m, M]$ on the $y$-axis, as shown in the figure. Note that in general several points of $[a, b]$ correspond to the same point of $[m, M]$. For example, the points $r$ and $s$ shown in the figure are both "mapped" by $f$ into the same point $l \in[m, M]$.
