> [!Summary] 
> $\delta$ distribution
> Tall and skinny distribution that is :
>  - $\delta(t)$ is zero everywhere except at 0 where it's basically infinite
>  - $\delta(t-\tau)$ will be zero everywhere except at $\tau$
>  - Integral over the real line is 1. Moreover $\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} \delta(x) dx = 1$ for any positive $\epsilon$, no matter how small it is.
>  - Because the area under that function is 1, it means that its height is $\frac {1}{2\epsilon}$, width being $2\epsilon$
