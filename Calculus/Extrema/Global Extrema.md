The global extrema involves comparison of a proposed extremum $f(p)$ with the value of $f$ at every point of the interval $I$ in which $f$ is defined, while the [[Local Extrema]] only require comparison of $f(p)$ with the values of $f$ at points "sufficiently near" $p$, or, for that matter, "arbitrarily near" $p$. 

$P$ is the global maximum in the interval $[a,b]$ and $A$ is the global minimum even though itâ€™s the end point of the interval. The derivative does not need to exist for a global extrema to exist.
