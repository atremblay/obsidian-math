The terms "antiderivative" and "integral" are often used interchangeably in a casual context because they are closely related, but there is a subtle and important difference between them in terms of formal mathematics.

1. **Antiderivative**: The antiderivative of a function $f(x)$ is another function $F(x)$ whose derivative is $f(x)$. In other words, it is a function that "undoes" the derivative operation. The antiderivative is also known as the indefinite integral or primitive of a function. One key point about antiderivatives is that they are not unique - if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then so is $F(x) + C$ for any constant $C$. This is why the antiderivative is often written as $F(x) + C$.

2. **Integral**: The integral of a function is a more complex concept that essentially calculates the "area under the curve" of the function. There are two types of integrals: definite and indefinite.

    - An **indefinite integral** is essentially the same as an antiderivative. It represents a family of functions $F(x)$ whose derivative is the original function $f(x)$. It's written in the form $\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C$.
    
    - A **definite integral** is quite different. It represents the signed area between the x-axis and the curve represented by the function $f(x)$, between two specific points $a$ and $b$. It's written in the form $\int_a^b  f(x) dx$. This is where the "area under the curve" idea comes from, and it doesn't have the "$+C$" term because it calculates a specific numerical value.

So the main difference between an antiderivative and an integral is this: an antiderivative is a function (or a family of functions), while a definite integral is a number. An indefinite integral, on the other hand, is just another name for an antiderivative.
