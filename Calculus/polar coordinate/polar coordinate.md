The x-axis is also called the Polar axis. The Polar axis is there to fix where $\theta = 0$. Could be anywhere, but the convention is to use the x-axis.

Just as $y$ is typically a function of $x$ ($f(x)$), $\rho$ is typically a function of $\theta$.

$\rho$ will usually have a positive value and $\theta$ will range from 0 to $2 \pi$.
