#### Abstract

In response to the continuing research interest in computational semantic analysis, we have proposed a new task for SemEval-2010: multi-way classification of mutually exclusive semantic relations between pairs of nominals. The task is designed to compare different approaches to the problem and to provide a standard testbed for future research. In this paper, we define the task, describe the creation of the datasets, and discuss the results of the participating 28 systems submitted by 10 teams.
