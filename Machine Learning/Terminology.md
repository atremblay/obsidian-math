> [!Definition]- Aleatoric uncertainty
> Also known as **data uncertainty**, refers to the inherent variability in the data itself. This type of uncertainty cannot be reduced by obtaining more data or improving the model. It is often modeled using probability distributions that capture the variability in the data. Examples of aleatoric uncertainty include measurement error, sensor noise, and natural variability in the data.

> [!Definition]- Epistemic uncertainty
> Also known as **model uncertainty**, refers to uncertainty in the model itself. This type of uncertainty can be reduced by improving the model or obtaining more data. Epistemic uncertainty arises due to the lack of knowledge or information about the underlying process being modeled. It can be further classified into two types: parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty arises due to uncertainty in the values of model parameters, while structural uncertainty arises due to uncertainty in the model structure itself.
