accronym: AR
definition: The Autoregressive Model relies only on past period values to predict current ones.
---

For example, RNN trained on predicting the next word by only considering past words.

Most large-scale models are trained in an auto-regressive way, but [[../../../../Explorance/Research/Papers/BERT]] shows that such models demonstrate poorer performance with traditional fine-tuning when adapting to downstream language understanding tasks.
